Core concepts:

Parameter:
    Anything that can theoretically be varied by the minimizer to find a valid minimum, be they normalization parameters,
    efficiency parameters (if allowed by the number of degrees of freedom)
    or nuisance parameters. So far every bin and every template has one associated nuisance parameter.

Template:
    A (normalized) histogram of a component in simulated data which is multiplied by the normalization parameter. The sum
    of multiplied templates is adjusted to match the recorded data.

Channel:
    Reconstruction channel, i.e. a dataset reconstructed in real data which can (and will) contain multiple decay channels

Component:
    Decay channel, possibly found in multiple reconstruction channels.
