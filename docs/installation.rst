Installation
============
The package can be installed using this commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/FelixMetzner/TemplateFitter
    cd TemplateFitter
    pip3 install ./

The last line will also install all requirements.

Alternatively, you can also clone the repository via

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:FelixMetzner/TemplateFitter.git

If you want to make changes to the package, we suggest to install it in editable mode
via the option `-e` or `--editable`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip3 install -e ./

This way you will not have to reinstall the package when you made any changes.
